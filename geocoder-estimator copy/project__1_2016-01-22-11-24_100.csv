2426944,"DRC Multi-modal Transport Transportation (General transportation sector): 100 The MTP will constitute the first transport project in DRC since the end of the civil war. Its aggregate estimated cost during its first phase covering is US$ 200 million (excluding labor retrenchment cost of about US$ 46 million) spread across all transport sub-sectors.The MTP main components are:  a) West/North-East Corridor   The West/North-East Corridor is the most important of all three multimodal corridors as it links the DRC's western maritime facade to its eastern lakes region via the Congo River. Major cities including Matadi, Kinshasa, Mbandaka, Kisangani and Bukavu are served by this corridor (see map in Annex 1). Enhancing its performance will strengthen the still fragile DRC unification process as well as lower significantly overall transport costs throughout the country. The main sub-components to be funded along this corridor will be implemented in support of public/private partnerships at Matadi port, along the Matadi/Kinshasa transport corridor link as well as Kinshasa N'djili international airport.   At the port of Matadi, since the rehabilitation of the quay of Matadi will be financed by the PMURR ahead of the MTP implementation, the project will finance through a US$ 5 million technical assistance package the necessary institutional reform of the port management system. This will be done with: a) the licensing and or concessioning to private operators of the port's stevedoring activities and, b) the establishment of an independent port authority using the landlord model.   The upgrading of the rail operations between Matadi and Kinshasa, i.e., CFMK, will be sought through the implementation, minimally, of a performance management contract with a private operator. This contract estimated three-year cost of US$ 5 million will be paid for by the MTP. Additionally, US$ 10 million will be made available to finance track rehabilitation works as well as rolling stock leasing. In this latter case, the use of Partial Risk Guarantee (PRG) is envisaged to secure up to US$ 20 million in leasing costs commitments. Finally, at Kinshasa N'djili International Airport, the MTP will provide up to US$ 50 million to finance the rehabilitation of the airport passenger and cargo terminals. This financing will complement planned AFD funding of the airport runway, taxiways and apron rehabilitation works. It will be contingent, however, on the transfer to a private operator of the management of the airport facilities.b) West/South-East Corridor   The West/South Corridor is also of a considerable importance to DRC. It links the country's western maritime facade to its south-eastern mining centers located in the Katanga province and serves as a trade corridor to Angola, Zambia and South Africa. The main MTP activity on this corridor will consist in supporting the transfer to a private operator of SNCC management with: a) US$ 60 million going toward the financing of track rehabilitation, b) US$ 10 million dedicated to pay for the estimated first three-year cost of a management contract and, c) US$ 10 million to cover rolling stock leasing cost. c) Nationwide   International donors' current road financing activities are mainly targeted at road rehabilitation work. Accordingly, little money has gone so far to upgrading DRC's road maintenance capacity with the likely consequence of a rapid deterioration of the pavement conditions of the newly rehabilitated roadways. Consequently, fully 1/4 of the MTP proposed credit, or US$ 50 million, will be earmarked to support road maintenance activities in DRC with the aim of: a) creating a reliable and autonomous technical and financial road maintenance capacity in DRC, and b) spurring the establishment of local private road maintenance small and medium enterprises. At this stage of project preparation, it is envisioned that the majority of the available funding for this activity will be dedicated to: a) financing a road fund whose creation is planned, b) financing personnel training at the Office des Routes as well as, c) funding road maintenance equipment leasing if required.   The design of the MTP rests on three guiding principles:   -No or limited money will be lent to SOEs.Current financial and management crises in the transport sector SOEs (see Table in Annex 7) precludes the Bank from making funds available to these enterprises when a clear and viable private sector alternative exists. -Investments in infrastructure will support and be tied to implementation of PPPs, whenever feasible.The transport sector in DRC generates in excess of US$ 200 million in revenues per year, most of which is in hard currency. A number of transport activities, therefore, lend themselves for various PPPs schemes as shown in Annex 8. -Lending will be preferably be used to fund infrastructure rather than equipment. Acquisition of rail and port equipment will be limited to a minimum since: a) the uncertainties regarding the level of future demand for certain transport activities, e.g., railways, do not support the risk of vast outlays of money within an environment of heavily constrained resources, and b) transport infrastructure targeted for rehabilitation should be able to sustain commercially viable operations; thus allowing private operators to lease and/or acquire necessary transport equipment."
2430323,"Integrated Coastal Zone Management Project Water, sanitation and flood protection (General water, sanitation and flood protection sector): 30, Agriculture, fishing, and forestry (General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector): 25, Water, sanitation and flood protection (Solid waste management): 25, Public Administration, Law, and Justice (General public administration sector): 10, Transportation (Ports, waterways and shipping): 10 Preliminary project descriptionThe project will have four components:(i) vulnerability and ecological mapping;(ii) institution building and strengthening at national level;(iii) development and implementation of state-level approaches to Integrated Coastal Zone Management; and(iv) project management.The costs for each component shown below are indicative at this early stage of preparation.Component I: Vulnerability and Ecological Mapping (US$25 million)-This component would include flood and erosional vulnerability and ESAs mapping and delimitation on the ground of different categories of coastal zones to be regulated for conservation and for protection against natural hazards. This would comprise of delimitation and mapping of coastal ecosystems and ecologically sensitive areas; demarcation of hazard zones susceptible to natural disasters and flooding; and verification and pilot assessments before revised national delimitation is undertaken. It would also take into account forecast impacts of climate change as applicable.Component II: National Institution Building & Capacity Strengthening (US$7 million)-This component would support national capacity building on coastal zone management: including the operationalization of a National Coastal Zone Management Authority of experts; establishment of a separate coastal zone management division within MoEF; development of relevant regulations and institutional set-ups guiding the linkages between the Center and the states in order to develop the nationwide approach to coastal zone management; and establishment of a National Institute for Sustainable Coastal Zone Management focusing on knowledge build-up and information sharing. In addition, the possibility of supporting two Regional Institutes for Sustainable Coastal Zone Management in different parts of India is going to be assessed during project preparation.-The component will be designed to actively link to the state-level institutional strengthening and capacity building in ICZM under Component III.Component III: Development and implementation of state-level approaches to Integrated Coastal Zone Management (US$70 million)-In this component, state-level approaches to ICZM would be developed and pilot projects would be implemented in specific geographical areas in the 3 selected states of Gujarat, Orissa, and West Bengal. The component would focus on:a. strengthening and capacity building of state-level Coastal Zone Management Authorities (current state authorities function on a committee basis, mainly dealing with ad hoc concerns and without continuous institutional or physical presence) and the relevant State administrative units in charge of integrated coastal zone management (for instance State Environment Departments), and their linkage with the national coastal zone management system (see Components I and II), andb. demonstration investments in critical areas related to conservation of the coastal environment, which would test the practical application of the coastal zone management approach in those states, as advocated in the Swaminathan Report. This would include development of integrated CZM plans, for instance with regard to tourism and eco-tourism. The focus would be to develop and implement operational models for integrated coastal zone management that could provide lessons for scaling-up.c. The pilot activities could include conservation and restoration of mangroves, including a few particularly relevant ones as a natural protection to valuable economic infrastructure; support to developing medium and small-scale coastal tourism facilities and networks, with linkage to improve the economic earning opportunities of the poor, and complementary reform and institution building (e.g. preparation of integrated coastal zone management plans for a few areas, such as areas to be managed by panchayats). The pilots are being selected in order to provide varying coastal zone management issues to be addressed so that active learning can take place and enable the relevant coastal zone management institutions to design replications and/or enhanced programs in the future.Component IV: Project Management (US$5 million)-Activities under this component would help ensure effective project management at national, state and district levels, information support, communications, and monitoring and evaluation. The project would be implemented by the MoEF and the State Level Coastal Zone Management Authorities. Harmonization with ADB and other agencies/organizations involved in the management of the coastal zone is being sought."
2430400,"Kenya Health Sector Support Project Health and other social services (Health): 100 3. Preliminary description   Key guiding principles: The proposed project aims to   Â·support priorities in the Government-led implementation of the NSSPII 2005-2010 (which are also reflected in the AOPs) through the SWAP framework; Â·support decentralization Â·promote evidence-based decision making and planning at all levels; Â·place special attention to the implementation of KEHP at the local level; with the focus on the poor and vulnerable Â·focus on areas where IDA has a comparative advantages (e.g. health financing, planning and budgeting, fiduciary, decentralization, and/or public-private partnership); Â·emphasize results in the long term, while supporting possible quick wins in the short and medium terms (capacity building, institutional strengthening); Â·use a phasing/sequencing approach on the basis of the preparation and negotiation of AOPs; Â·support disease control programs (especially malaria) through health system strengthening as part of the SWAP, in line with the malaria booster program strategy for Kenya; Â·utilize government management systems to the extent possible, but not before assurance is obtained that such systems meet the required standards of accountability and transparency; Â·ensure good coordination among all stakeholders (including the private sectors and development partners); and Â·apply safeguard mechanisms to mitigate the risk of corruption.   It is likely that the project design would encompass two main types of component within the NHSSP II: service delivery and institutional strengthening.   (i) Service delivery at the local level to improve health of the poor and vulnerable:  This component would support the implementation of the KEHP, including the delivery of quality essential services in an equitable and efficient manner at the district, sub-district and community levels (corresponding to levels 1 to 4 of the KEHP), with a focus on under-served areas, the poor and vulnerable. The component would be based on AOPs, and also on the results of various pilots (such as different models for budget transfer to local level) now underway. These include pilot projects already being supported by the EU, DANIDA, SIDA and the MOH itself. They would also be similar to the original pilots planned for support through the restructured DARE Project. Emphasis will be put on the achievement of results and outcomes at the district level.   (ii) Institutional strengthening, capacity building and new policy development:This component would support key, selected interventions, such as:   a) Deepening decentralization; b) Improving MOH capacity to fulfill its stewardship functions, especially to plan, budget, regulate, monitor and evaluate better for improved health; c) Strengthening public-private partnership; d) Improving human resources for health, possibly including in-service training, the development and implementation of human resource policies and strategies (e.g. incentives for health professionals, performance-based contracting and appraisal); e) Strengthening health financing and payment systems, including possibly the development of new policies in key areas such as health financing and the reform of payment systems to increase resources for health and provide better financial protection for the poor; and f) Strengthening common management systems, with a focus on financial management, procurement, management of essential drugs and supplies, as well as monitoring and evaluation.   It should be emphasized that the IDA support would not cover all of the above, unless as part of abasket approach with other partners, due to the need for selectivity."
2430427,"Fostering Agricultural Productivity in Mali Agriculture, fishing, and forestry (Irrigation and drainage): 35, Agriculture, fishing, and forestry (Agricultural extension and research): 30, Agriculture, fishing, and forestry (General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector): 15, Agriculture, fishing, and forestry (Animal production): 15, Public Administration, Law, and Justice (General public administration sector): 5 To answer the GoM's overall objective of food security, get quick results and avoid scattered interventions, infrastructure investments and service provision will be concentrated on key staple productions systems, which could be on a preliminary approach:  (i) the rice system (irrigated and rainfed)(ii) the mixed cotton/cereal system(iii) rainfed mixed cereal/staple production system (including cowpeas, potatoes for instance)(iv) one or two livestock production systems. Consistent with the three major constraints to agriculture modernizations mentioned above, the project will be organized along the following components: 1- **Productive investments**:This component will finance the development of infrastructure with a focus on agricultural water management, post-harvest operation and livestock production. 2- **Technology transfer and service provision to producers**: This component will address the weak capacities of all stakeholders, with a specific focus on producer organizations, and help producers tackle key constraints to productivity increase through the provision of packages of agricultural services. This will include technical advice and access to inputs, training and access to information, farm management advice and access to markets, as well as financial services.The component encompasses the provision of efficient public services to producers, as well as the private delivery of agricultural and financial services through POs, input suppliers, banks and micro-finance institutions. Strategic and demand-driven research will constitute another critical area of investments. The component will invest in disseminating research results on new varieties, diversification, mechanization or innovative practices, including environment-friendly agricultural practices and SLWM technologies in general. Seed production will be a strong area of investments to increase availability of improved varieties. 3- **Comprehensive programmatic approach and sector monitoring**: Interventions will support the dialogue between key Ministries, POs, private sector representatives and donors, to achieve a better organization and coordination of the agricultural sector. It will forge a shared vision among all stakeholders towards a programmatic approach to agricultural productivity and around the implementation of the LOA. It will lead to the elaboration of a comprehensive agricultural investment framework to move towards a SWAp. Beyond the usual M&E system for the project, this component will strengthen existing monitoring and evaluation services to restore the regular production of reliable agricultural statistics and expand existing market information services. Thanks to GEF inputs, this component will also support the development of tools to closely monitor land degradation and ecosystem evolution. Project coordination and implementation: Overall project implementation will be under the direct oversight of the Ministry of Agriculture, but the Ministry of Livestock and Fisheries, the Food Security Commissariat and the Ministry of Environment will be fully in charge of implementing activities in their specific field of responsibilities. POs will play a key role in project implementation, especially for field investments in infrastructure and in delivering advisory services."
2430428,"CN-Sustainable Dev. in Poor Rural Areas Agriculture, fishing, and forestry (General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector): 45, Water, sanitation and flood protection (General water, sanitation and flood protection sector): 20, Industry and trade (Agricultural marketing and trade): 20, Transportation (Roads and highways): 15 Community-Driven Development (CDD) Approach. The Government views greater local autonomy and community participation in development activities as key elements of an effective rural poverty reduction program. This new thinking is reflected in China's 11th Five-Year Plan and a number of participatory poverty reduction approaches have already been tested in Bank-supported CDD pilot projects. While these pilots primarily introduced international experience into China, notably from Indonesia and the Philippines, LGPR has also further developed and adapted these pilots to specifically take account of the varying local conditions and demands in China's poor areas. Building on this wide array of implementation experience, the Government is now fully confident to expand the CDD approach through the proposed project on a much broader scale with the aim to build community capacity and more effectively implement poverty reduction measures in remote poverty pockets. Specifically, the proposed project's CDD approach will seek to give poor rural communities: (a) the opportunity to improve access to local infrastructure and public services; collectively manage project resources; and take ownership of development(b) more effective community organization and management capacity and esteem(c) an improved relationship with local government agencies to become more responsive to a community's priorities.The CDD approach will build on a number of key principles that have proven to be best suited to the Chinese context and have led to good poverty alleviation results in the pilots.First, communities will be responsible for participatory village development planning. Villagers will be fully informed of the available project resources at project start-up. Prioritization and decision making on key project investments will be done through a process of consultations and competitive project selection within the framework of existing institutions, such as village committees and village meetings. These institutions will be supported and supplemented by community facilitators, village supervision and monitoring committees, and project implementation groups. By implementing CDD activities through existing institutions, the project will avoid creating parallel implementing structures and ensure the long-term sustainability of the investments. Second, communities will be responsible for the implementation of project investment activities. This will include procurement and contract management, the organization of villagers' contributions, construction supervision, and monitoring and reporting. Communities will also take responsibility for managing project funds through the operation of village-level accounts that will be set up in the name of each administrative village at nearby financial institutions. Third, county and township governments will take on a service provider function and will support communities through technical staff of line departments to help ensure the (a) adherence to technical standards and quality of project investments; (b) adequate supervision of construction implementation; and (c) completion certification and reporting. CDD implementation will be guided by an Operations Manual that defines the roles and responsibilities of the involved institutions, describes the project cycle and fund management arrangements, and lays out a governance and monitoring framework. **Project Summary******Through the CDD approach, the project will promote the active involvement of villagers in community development processes, enabling them to collectively identify and prioritize local needs, prepare and select local subprojects in a fair, equitable and transparent manner, and develop their own collective capacities for implementation, project management, monitoring and maintenance. In addition, the project will (a) assist rural migrants residing in urban areas to overcome the dangerous working and living conditions and other difficulties they face in the urban environment, and (b) provide additional assistance to rural communities to identify and analyze climate change adaptation risks and address such risks through improved and more sustainable management of the surrounding natural and land resources.The total investment of the project will be about US$155 million including financing from the World Bank (US$100 million), the Government of China and provincial and local funds (US$50 million), and a GEF Grant (US$5 million). The project would comprise the following five components: **Component 1: CDD.** The CDD component will reach out to poor villages and address the lack of basic rural infrastructure and the persistently poor enabling environment for participation in economic development. The component will provide investment support for the construction and improvement of village access roads, drinking water supply systems, rural sanitation infrastructure, electrification, communication infrastructure, school building construction and repair, small-scale agriculture production infrastructure (such as cisterns and water storage systems, irrigation and drainage, and land terracing and other land improvements), and basic housing repair. Implementation will be demand-driven to ensure that infrastructure investments will meet the needs that have been identified by the villagers themselves as most urgent preconditions for improved well-being.**Component 2: CDG. ****** The CDG (Community Development Grant) component would address the current lack of basic income sources in remote villages by providing small block grants to communities to support household-level productive activities such as improved and diversified crop production, animal husbandry, and other income generating activities. The CDG approach would draw on the experiences of a number of CDD and CDF pilots currently being implemented and tested in China. It would promote the full devolvement of all implementation, management and supervision responsibilities to participating villages, with informed and self-determined choices for productive activities. CDG implementation would be accompanied by carefully sequenced capacity building at the village level, including farmer training in technical and vocational skills, infrastructure operation and management, community development, skills training for women, and training in fund operation and management. Capacity building would also include support to the extension services of key line bureaus, access to market information, and awareness campaigns about off-farm labor opportunities for farmers.**Component 3:  Rural Migrants Support.** The rural migrant support component would address the challenges associated with China's on-going large scale rural-to-urban migration, a defining factor of China's urbanization process, with the objective of exploring a replicable model which could be scaled-up nationwide. The identified challenges include unsafe housing conditions and harsh living environments, lack of vocational training for better and more stable job opportunities, absence of financial assistance to migrant workers to start their own business, very limited access to basic social services such as legal assistance and health care, and relatively weak capacity of administrating migrant workers affairs, including a weak monitoring and evaluation system. The component will support activities to improve migrant workers dormitories, mainly through renovation instead of constructing new buildings; providing vocational training; establishing revolving funds, similar to the CDF approach (of component 2), to provide financial support to migrant workers' micro-enterprises; establishing migrant community service centers to provide social services such as legal aid, AIDS and STD prevention, and care for migrant women and migrant's children including protection of women's rights and children's schooling. The component will also support activities to improve the current monitoring and evaluation system and a research activity to examine the relationship between migration and poverty alleviation, based on the component's experiences, for making policy recommendations to the municipal and central governments. The component will be implemented in Chongqing (in Wanzhou District, Fuling District, Yunyang County, Youyang County, and in the Chongqing Municipality itself) where there are large concentrations of migrant workers.**Component 4: Climate Change Adaptation and Sustainable Land Management (GEF-co-financing).** This component will address potential climate change risks and land degradation issues that are closely linked with rural poverty and related to the limited carrying capacities of the fragile dryland and mountain ecosystems in the project area, unsustainable agricultural and other land use practices, and lack of alternative income sources. The component will seek to improve the awareness of emerging climate change risks and potential impacts on livelihoods and provide support to develop and implement simple adaptation measures. These measures are expected to be related primarily to agriculture, land and water resource management and may include: land rehabilitation and protection investments, including silt arresting structures, flood bank protection, erosion control measures, and restoration of native forest, steppe and grassland vegetation; activities to ameliorate current land management, such as improved cropping and grazing practices, and community land use planning and zonation to reduce use intensity; broadening genetic diversity and species pools of important agriculture crops; and support for institutional and community-level capacity building. This component will be implemented under the CDD approach and in close coordination with component 1 and 2.**Component 5: Project Management, Monitoring and Evaluation. ****** The project management and monitoring and evaluation (M&E) component would facilitate the efficient implementation of the project and the coordination between the various government agencies at national, provincial and local levels. Specifically, the component would include support for (a) overall project management and implementation, including government staff training, office equipment, vehicles, and (b) design and implementation of a comprehensive project MIS system, including progress, financial and impact monitoring and evaluation. In addition, it will support the design of the project's overall participatory and CDD approach that is envisaged to cover all project components. This would include the development of guidelines for participatory planning of community development and productive activities, provision of community facilitators to support the set up and operation of CDFs, participatory planning and implementation guidelines for the rural migrant workers component, participatory monitoring and evaluation of project activities, and implementation support for the participatory and CDD approach."
2430439,"Technical and Vocational Education Modernization Project Education (Vocational training): 50,Education (Tertiary education): 30,Education (General education sector): 20 3. Preliminary project descriptionThe Technical and Vocational Education Restructuring Program seeks to rebuild and to improve efficiency of the current TVE system by transforming it from a supply-driven system into a system that has the capacity to offer programs that are responsive to the learning and skills development needs of students and business (demand-led) in a cost effective manner. The proposed project will consist of two main components:Component 1: Improve quality and relevance of TVE by reforming the structure and program of studies of TVE at the secondary and post-secondary level.The main objectives of this component are to(i) rebuild the program of studies of secondary TVE by promoting a full integration of general and TVE secondary education programs and institutions. All youth enrolled in secondary education will be provided with secondary education TVE programs, they would not be limited to those specifically designated as vocational education students. These programs would be only offered in secondary schools, not in colleges;(ii) restructure and streamline the current network of post-secondary technical and vocational education institutions and programs of studies to make it more responsive to the demands of graduates from secondary education and the needs of the local economy. At the upper secondary level all students would be able to pursue a vocational concentration that would open for them flexible venues for employment and the possibility to continue post-secondary education or training. These new 'concentrations' would offer career development opportunities offering broad skills and competencies that are relevant to many occupations in the labor market. They would be developed around broad occupational families in well defined groups of occupational area (such as Construction, Financial Services, Business and Administrative Services, Health and Social Services, etc) and will introduce students to career paths. These paths could lead to entry level employment opportunities in specific careers or to higher education in more specific occupational majors in post-secondary technical and vocational institutions or in higher education. The project would also promote a strong integration between general and technical vocational secondary education study programs. General subjects in TVE secondary schools would follow the same syllabus as similar subjects in general secondary schools. It is expected that over time the distinction between general and TVE secondary schools will blur out. The integration of general and TVE secondary education will make the deployment of staff, resources and equipment more efficient. It would be easier for studies to be conducted in the best premises for each program. In this sense the proposed project will promote and support the consolidation of secondary schools when conditions are favorable. Consolidation would allow a more efficient utilization of resources such as expensive special facilities and technical equipment; it would also reduce administrative costs by reducing the number of bureaucratic transactions and optimize staff deployment. The proposed project would fund technical assistance for the development of a standard set of occupational 'concentrations' or families that would be offered to all secondary school youth. This will be done in close consultation with the business community. It would also finance the development and provision of corresponding program of studies, development, printing and distribution of new textbooks, training of teachers and principals, provision of teaching materials and equipment, and rehabilitation of infrastructure.   At the post-secondary level students will be able to attend specialized vocational programs with clearly defined ladders of qualifications or progression routes based on a credit system. Introducing ladders of qualifications will require the reform of current learning and teaching practices which are guided by a curricula that is focused on mastering subject content and completing a defined number of hours per subject to teaching practices based on a curricula that focuses on demonstrating the mastery of skills and competencies. The introduction of a credit system will make the system more flexile and will allow the holder of qualifications to move through the ladder at their own pace without having to repeat learning or loosing time. The efficiency of the system would increase by reducing the time to produce a graduate and early departure. Mastery of competencies and recognition of qualifications will be certified using a new outcome based assessment system. The introduction of a credit system together with competency based approach to learning and teaching will require substantial investments to change the program of studies, train teachers and principals, introduce new forms for delivery of programs, and to provide access to up-to-date equipment and to opportunities for on-the-job learning. The clustering of programs on broad occupational areas together with the introduction of competency based approach to learning and teaching and of new forms for the delivery of programs (such as WEB based interactive programs and interactive distance programs supported by information technologies) will not only help upgrade the status of post-secondary technical and vocational education programs but will also foster the consolidation of institutions. Thus the proposed project will also support the consolidation of institutions into a smaller number that can provide more comprehensive program of studies. In addition to investment related to the reform of the program of studies, there will be a need to invest on the upgrade of facilities and equipment. In order to promote transparency and accountability the proposed program will help develop a system of attestation/certification of students' skills and competencies. This system will also provide employers with a transparent signaling system to facilitate their hiring decisions. The proposed project would fund technical assistance for the introduction of the credit system, for the establishment of a new outcome based system for attestation and certification of skills and competencies and for conducting background studies and stakeholder consultation to guide the consolidation of institutions. It would also finance the development and provision of new program of studies, development, printing and distribution of new textbooks and teaching materials, training of teachers, management training of education administrators at all levels of the system, provision of equipment, and building of new institutions as well as rehabilitation of some dilapidated school infrastructure.Component 2: Improve system efficiency and accountability through reform of governance and financing.By and large the aim of this component is to upgrade management and governance capacity throughout the TVE system and to rationalize funding allocation mechanisms so that the allocation of resources is done using transparent criteria based on real demand and results. This will be done through the following set of interrelated interventions.(i) Introduction of a national qualification framework to help guide the integration of programs, the introduction of the credit and a competency based system for the accreditation of skills and competencies.(ii) Develop a reliable system for attestation and certification of skills and competencies. This system will make available a transparent signaling system that would help students market their skill and would guide employers' hiring decisions.(iii) Introductions of quality management practices at all levels of the system, including capacity to monitor and evaluate the performance of the TVE institutions and the quality of TVE programs, as well as capacity for collecting, analyzing and using information for the systematic identification of skills development needs of individuals and enterprises, for assessing and monitoring the performance of the system, and for allocating resources based on demands, needs and results.(iv) Introduce funding mechanisms that allocate resources based on needs and results using a per-capita budgeting mechanisms that that are transparent and easy to monitor. The proposed project would fund technical assistance for the establishment on of a national qualification system, for the introduction of new funding mechanisms and for all the related management training required for the successful implementation of these changes. It would also fund technical assistance, equipment and software required for the establishment of a management information system that produces timely and reliable information.2.

2430453,"Judicial Reform Project Public Administration, Law, and Justice (Law and justice): 100 3. Preliminary descriptionComponent 1: Judicial Administration and Court ManagementThe project will focus on:(a) enhancing the role of court presidents in managing the court operations in all significant areas, such as financial management, human resources management, strategic planning, performance monitoring and case-flow management;(b) creating case-management teams within courts;(c) reform of court financing, including analysis of the current financing practices, reform of the judicial budget planning and management system, increasing financial independence of courts and financial authority of court presidents, reform of the court fees system;(d) further upgrading and re-engineering of the court statistics, performance monitoring and management by results; and(e) developing functional and building standards for court facilities.Component 2: Rationalization of the court networkRestructuring of the court system is needed, which would allow more rational organization of the network of courts and their jurisdiction, mergers of smaller courts into larger units, and more efficient allocation of human and financial resources within the court system. With the support of PAL-1 and PAL-2 and technical assistance from the EU consultants, the Ministry of Justice conducted a comprehensive analysis of the existing court system and developed a Plan for Court Rationalization. The Ministry also launched a pilot for merging municipal and misdemeanor courts in selected municipalities. Implementation of the Rationalization Plan will be a challenging undertaking and will involve further analysis, cost estimates, transfer of judges and court personnel from one court to another, re-training, revisions to the procedural norms, adjusting the court facilities and other logistical arrangements. The implementation process is likely to last for several years, and closure, merger and reorganization of courts of various jurisdictions will be done in phases. It is already apparent that closure of courts will be resisted by many, including judges themselves and local politicians. The project will provide assistance for the implementation of the Rationalization Plan in several areas, including re-adjustment and rehabilitation of court facilities in order to accommodate the changes in the organizational structure of the court system.Component 3: Court AutomationThe Ministry of Justice identified several areas where it requests continued support from the Bank and which are closely related to further implementation of the ICMS (which was financed under the CBAP). These include:(a) Document Management System Development, piloting and roll-out:Augmenting the ICMIS system with a document management system (DMS) is a logical next step after implementation of the ICMS system. This application would enable the courts to create, receive, send, store, search and tracks all documents used within legal proceedings. This includes not only internal documents, but also external documents. Given the past positive piloting experience with ICMS it is envisioned to pilot this application as well in at least three courts. (estimated pilot cost USD 1.3 million). A rollout of a functional DMS system to all institutions of the judiciary would require an additional amount of USD 4 million and would cover the purchase of the necessary storage hardware for dispersed facilities.(b) Increased Connectivity for the Judicial Network:Very high on MOJ's agenda is the increased connectivity for the wider judiciary. This improved Judicial Network would cover, by the end of the proposed project, all institutions: Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Finance, Tax Authorities, Penitentiaries, Prosecutors Offices, Enforcement Offices, Land Registration Offices, etc.(c) E-Filing:Currently the judicial institutions have no direct data communication. With the improvement of the Judicial Network it is envisioned to allow electronic data exchange between all the judicial institutions. This step will significantly reduce costs and processing time for the judiciary. This will also be a milestone for MOJ's vision of a modern e-judiciary setup.(d) Management Reporting Tool:The ICMS software needs a new module to enhance the application with statistical and management-reporting capabilities. A new statistical module should be developed to generate management reports on the court level as well as on the MOJ level. Different analysis, beside the standard absolute case numbers and percent values should be introduced. This could include trend analysis, sophisticated data modeling and others.Component 4: Judicial TrainingThe project would focus on two issues:(i) development of a comprehensive system for initial judicial training (presently, non-existent); and(ii) support to the Judicial Academy: both, in terms of strengthening institutional capacity of the Academy, and improving the system of continued judicial education."

Preliminary DescriptionSpecifically, the proposed project would comprise three components:Component 1 - Local Planning, Management and Investment would focus on strengthening the supply side of local development and governance, to ensure more effective and sustainable use of public resources as well as participatory decision making. Component activities would target selected local administrations, and would finance:(i) technical assistance to improve their organizational and technical capacities to plan, implement and manage local development plans and investments in a participatory and accountable manner3; and(ii) matching grants to execute basic public goods and services defined in the local participatory development plans, such as social and economic infrastructure at the community level.Component 2 - Social Accountability would focus on enhancing the demand side of local development and governance, aiming to increase communities' capacity to access information,engaging in decision making, and increasing governments' accountability to citizens' preferences.Component activities would target existing civic engagement bodies (Municipal Forums/CACS and Communal Forums), improving their functionality to increase membership and voice, increasing citizen's budget literacy, developing further their capacities to improve representation, quality of participation, negotiation skills and oversight of local policy making and expenditure management processes.Component 3 - Quality of Basic Services Provision would refine and pilot tools and mechanisms to improve the quality of provision of health and education services at the local level.In principle, this component would try to create an improved nexus between the more traditional orientation of the social fund on access to basic services with the broader dimensions of the quality of service provision. Component activities would include grants to municipal administrations, community organizations and neighborhood health/education committees and the like to implement selected interventions to achieve specific service delivery outcomes/results, such as improve student enrollments, retention, teaching quality, immunization rates, etc. The component would pilot accountability-promotion activities, such as school-based management, the improvement of information provision to school or clinic stakeholders, and/or teacher or nurse contracting. Activities are expected to be included in the local development plans and/or annual work plans of NGOs/CBOs or relevant partner organization."

Preliminary descriptionLending instrument and modality.This project will use a Sectoral Investment Lending instrument and will be financed under IBRD terms and conditions.Component A. Policy and regulatory framework:Implement specific arrangements for governance, financing and quality assurance procedures of new-model research universities (in harmony with sector-wide framework being developed under the Second Higher Education Project currently under implementation). In particular, this model would give wide autonomy to the universities regarding degrees and programs, recruitment and management; with ex-post rather than a-priori monitoring by MOET.Component B. University establishment and development:Design, build and equip two new-model research universities; establish management systems (including governance, financing and quality assurance systems); develop and deliver training program for leadership, management, teaching and research staff.  The Vietnam-German University will be a completely new multi-disciplinary science-oriented institution, created from a partnership between the Ho Chi Minh City National University and a consortium of German universities (with a strong German input in the areas of governance, teaching and research);  the Can Tho University sub-project will likely involve the upgrading and reforming of part or all of the existing Can Tho University.Component C. Project implementation management:Manage project; monitor performance and results.   Monitoring and evaluation .A project monitoring and evaluation framework will be developed during the preparation stage, with the definition of indicators to be monitored throughout the project life. Indicators will relate, at different levels, to(i) the Government's HERA,(ii) the projects' specific development objectives, and(iii) key activities planned under each project component and sub-component.Verifiable indicators (e.g., number of intakes and graduates at undergraduate, master, and doctoral levels; number of articles published in the referee journals; number of patents/licenses obtained, etc.) will be identified and developed based on the overall medium and long-term objectives of the project in order to monitor progress against the project development objectives. Since it will however be difficult to see the positive impact on graduates and research within the first five years of project implementation, such quantitative indicator monitoring will be supplemented by an external institutional evaluation based primarily on qualitative data."

An APL provides phased support forlong-term development programs. It would involve a series of loans that build on the lessons learnedfrom the previous loan(s) in the series. The anticipated phases of the APL can be outlined as follows: Phase 1: Nairobi Institutional and Financial Restructuring Modest investment in high visibility, low cost, pro-poor infrastructurePhase 2: Broadening and deepening in Nairobi, if institutional and financial restructuring targets are met: medium-scale investmentsin critical infrastructure, e.g. slum upgrading, landfill, transportation In other urban centers: institutional and financial reform as needed, plus modest investment as in Nairobi Phase 3: At scale In Nairobi, if institutional and financial sustainability is established: larger scale investment e.g.in transport and slum upgrading; In other urban centers: medium to large-scale investment as in Nairobi Phase 1 can be described in some detail. This phase focuses on institutional and financial recovery torestore public and investor confidence, to deliver services, and to assure that future capital investment is not wasted. There will also be a modest amount of pro-poor transport investment. Future phases will deepen the investment in Nairobi (contingent on success with financial and institutional reform) and roll the approach out to other urban centers. The anticipated components of Phase 1 are: Component 1: Financial and Institutional Restructuring of the City of NairobiSubcomponent 1(a) Institutional restructuring and GovernanceThis subcomponent would support measures designed to improve Council's ability to reliably and costeffectively deliver services. It would address the organizational culture of the City Council and staff, capacity development needs, data for planning and management, and the HIV/AIDS disease burden. This subcomponent could include decentralising administration and service delivery to five proposed subcouncils (boroughs) and/or to 55 wards. It could help support the development of an effective framework for public private partnerships, and would be designed to support coordination between the City Council's efforts and those of sectoral ministries and the Constituency Development Fund. The subcomponent would support the development and enforcement of internal governance measures, such as a framework regarding roles and responsibilities of councillors in setting policy and overseeing implementation vs. the executive role of the town clerk and department heads in implementation and reporting.Subcomponent 1(b) Financial management and recoveryThis subcomponent would support measures to assure that planning and budgeting are linked, that budgets are realistic, that budget planning includes three year indicative figures for revenue and expenditure, that operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure is appropriately financed, that expenditure control measures protect against abuse, and that revenue collection is appropriately managed. A program for managing short- and long-term debt would be established. Systems of checks and balances, including but not limited to meaningful council oversight would be developed.Component 2: Modest, Pro-poor Infrastructure.Recognizing that almost half of all home-work trips in Nairobi are made on foot and that these are predominantly by very poor people, the project will support urban mobility through modest investments in non-motorized transport (i.e. paths for pedestrians, bicyclists and push-carts) and in the upgrading of spine roads (i.e. collector streets) with resurfacing and storm drainage. Pedestrian paths will link areas where the urban poor live with locations where they walk to work. The spine roads will be selected based on links between low and middle income residential areas carrying matatu and mini bus traffic. While these initiatives will be relatively low cost and have modest maintenance requirements, they will enable the CCN to demonstrate its pro-poor policies and facilitate the building of its internal institutional and financial capacity to design, implement and manage higher levels of infrastructure. The IDA team reviewed the Nairobi City Engineer's proposed locations for non motorised transportion (NMT) and associated improvements to safely and conveniently accommodate pedestrians, bicycles, and pushcarts."
2430631,"Vocational Training Education (Vocational training): 100 III. PRELIMINARY DESCRIPTION Since the development of a high quality TVET subsector is a long-term agenda, the proposed Bank project supports only the first phase of such a development. The project aims to support training in select sectors, through a limited number of institutions through competitive grants. The project will have three main components. Component 1 aims to improve the quality and relevance of training by linking the demand of employers and employees to training providers, both public and private. Training will be oriented towards employment and thus, program needs should be determined by trade and commercial associations, employers associations, and industry. Public and private training providers will play a supporting role, under the overall auspices of the Bangladesh Technical Education Board (BTEB). Flexible training programs will be introduced, allowing trainees to enter and the leave the system as and when they desire, and thereby enabling a direct linkage with the world of work. Short-term training programs which are modular and competency-based will be developed for select sectors. Component 2 will focus on improving institutional capacity of key entities such as the Department of Technical Education (DTE), Bangladesh Technical Education Board (BTEB) and other potential implementing agencies to effectively implement and assess program quality and outcomes. The development of quality assurance mechanisms will be an integral part of this component. Component 3 aims to develop the necessary capacity to effectively monitor the access to programs, the effectiveness of program delivery (in conjunction with the quality assurance mechanisms developed under Component 2), and the critical outcomes of the program in terms of the labor market outcomes for trainees."
2430637,"DRC - Agriculture Rehabilitation and Recovery Support Agriculture, fishing, and forestry (Agricultural extension and research): 100 To achieve the Project's development objectives, the proposed project will support four components:  (i) Rural Infrastructure Development; (ii) Agricultural Productivity Enhancing, (iii) Capacity Building; and (iv) Project Implementation Support.Component I:   Rural Infrastructure Development will provide funding for two main types of infrastructure development (i) roads and (ii) market infrastructure. The rehabilitation of road networks is critical to open up markets and foster agricultural production. Given the lack of significant national road networks, this rehabilitation and construction process should focus, in the short-term, on rural road networks and related civil works within and among the three targeted provinces of this Project. The Rural Road Master Plan has surveyed about 20,000km of such roads; only 8,000 kms have been rehabilitated under the rural road component of the ongoing IDA Emergency Multi-sector Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Project. Further, under the same project, allocations were made for rehabilitation of rural roads in the three provinces targeted by this Project: Bas Congo (11); Kasai Oriental (2); and Kasai Occidental (3). These roads have been completed but there is a strong concern regarding their maintenance and there have been no attempts at interconnection of these routes. This proposed Project should therefore engage in interconnecting these routes as a logical next step as well as address the issue of road maintenance. Finally, to begin to explore opportunities for market-oriented growth, logistical support facilities will also need to be developed. This sub-component will therefore support Page 4 construction and/or repairs to grain/produce storage facilities and physical market places in targeted areas.Component II: Agricultural Productivity Enhancing aims at disseminating improved crop and animal husbandry practices to smallholders. Activities undertaken will (a) support/strengthen adaptive research for technology development and dissemination activities, including farmer advisory services. These set of activities will focus on testing and adapting existing technologies to specific environments and farmers' circumstances and will include extension services as well as development and dissemination of appropriate information materials; (b) support access to agricultural inputs and livestock and fisheries technologies and services, for example through seed multiplication and animal breeding activities. It is envisioned that a scaling-up of the seed multiplication scheme under the EMRRP will be undertaken. In this context, special attention will be given to ensuring that the dissemination of improved seeds reaches the target groups, a current challenge under the EMRRP; and (c) in addition, both this and the capacity building sub-components will provide support for basic tool and equipment acquisition. During project preparation this will be further identified. Component III:  Capacity Building aims at revamping agricultural institutions and equipping them with material and human resources congruent with the importance of the overall economy; this component will basically support the Ministry of Agriculture and producer organizations by: (a) beefing up the departments in charge of programming and execution of public expenditures, and research; (b) strengthening the department in charge of monitoring and evaluation by developing/strengthening information and M&E systems to help monitor the sector activities; (c) providing assistance to undertake a staffing and functional review of the ministry that would lead to recommendations for a comprehensive human resource development plan and possible restructuring of the ministry; and (d) strengthening producer and community organizations' capacities for planning, budgeting, and management and basic information systems of these organizations. Component IV: Project Implementation Support aims at  ensuring compliance with legal and fiduciary Project requirements. The component will support activities that address financial management, accounting, audits, project development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation, project management, information system, design and supervision of works, and operation logistics. During Project preparation, alternative implementation arrangements will be considered, including using the existing EMRRP (BCECO)."
2430654,"RY-INTEGRATED URBAN DEVELOPMENT Public Administration, Law, and Justice (Sub-national government administration): 40,Water, sanitation and flood protection (Flood protection): 20,Water, sanitation and flood protection (Solid waste management): 20,Water, sanitation and flood protection (General water, sanitation and flood protection sector): 20 3. Preliminary description Page 3Component 1: Upgrading ($20.00 million, in addition to $2.00 million SFD, and $30.00 million financing gap)Yemen is experiencing rapid urbanization. Urban centers like Sana'a and Taiz have clocked average annual growth rates of approximately 8% over the last ten years, fueled by rapid rural-to-urban migration. Between 1977 and 2004, Sana'a Municipality's population grew from a mere 162,000 persons to reach 1,747,627 inhabitants. This amounts to an average growth rate of 9.2% per annum throughout the period, making it one of the fastest growing cities in the world. This rapid growth was compounded with the repatriation of Yemeni workers from the Gulf countries in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War.   In Sana'a city, massive population growth, coupled with the absence of appropriate urban planning and regulation instruments, has led to a proliferation of informal settlements at a very rapid pace since 1990. Much construction in Sana'a over the past decade has taken place in unplanned areas without building permits and without infrastructure and services. Several squatter settlements are located in flood paths and marginal land, and are mostly occupied by poor marginalized communities. The squatter population has no secure land tenure and lacks access to basic infrastructure and municipal services. Moreover, most of the squatter population lives in poor and unhygienic living conditions in wooden and zinc shacks that are prone to fire hazards due to their high density (fires in squatter areas in the past five years with losses in lives have increased the pressure on government to address this issue). The improvement of living conditions in informal and squatter settlements and the socio-economic integration of the poor in the city's fabric are pressing priorities and explicit aims of local authorities in Sana'a.   In Taiz city, while there is limited squatting, there is significant informal and unplanned housing development. The 2006 Taiz city Master Plan reports that informal or unplanned housing amounts to 60% of the total built up area and that 10% of the city's housing stock is illegal, located in marginal land and areas prone to floods and landslides, and mostly held by squatters without land ownership. Informal development typically takes place on legally owned land, but in contravention of planning and building regulations and lacking access to basic infrastructure and municipal services. Clusters of extreme poverty are found in fringe areas, namely Taizziya and Saber. Since land and housing are more affordable on the outskirts, these areas receive an inflow of rural migrants as well as poorer residents from the inner city districts, and are thus growing at a much higher rate than the inner city. Yet, these areas are mostly not connected to water, sanitation and electricity networks, and are deprived of key municipal services.   Investments under Component 1 would focus on improving service delivery and living conditions in selected informal and squatter settlements in priority urban centers, namely Taiz and Sana'a, which have been identified as priority in the citywide urban upgrading strategies completed for both cities. Works would include the design and execution of pedestrian and vehicular access, water, sewerage connections, electricity connections, storm water drainage, public lighting, and community facilities. Component 1 will also support the costs of community outreach and environmental education programs associated with ensuring maintenance of the infrastructure (in partnership with the SFD). Finally, Component 1 will finance the resettlement of any households or businesses that are required to relocate to facilitate upgrading and ensure a basic road network that would enable emergency access. Preparation is also underway of a grant application to the Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF) to finance socio-economic development activities to improve the livelihoods of residents in the poor settlements where IUDP upgrading and infrastructure investments will take place, including inter alia vocational training, micro-credit and community organization activities.Component 2: Solid Waste Management ($8.00 million, in addition to $5.00 million financing gap)Until 1999, responsibility for Solid Waste Management (SWM) in Yemeni cities was exclusively within the domain of the central government, leading to poorly organized or even non-existent waste collection and disposal systems at the local level. Cleaning Law No. 40 of 1999 decentralized SWM and allowed localities to collect revenues to be used to support solid waste collection and disposal operations on a cost recovery basis. Prime Minister Decree No. 20 of 1999 created Cleaning and Improvement Funds (CIF) at the Governorate level, which are replenished with several fees and surcharges for use in cleaning and city improvement purposes. The CIF is an important off-budget revenue source for local governments that plays an important role in financing capital investments. The Governor chairs the CIF Board of Directors.   Despite the devolution of SWM responsibilities to the local level and establishment of dedicated funding, waste collection and disposal services, generally speaking, suffer from a lack of operational guidelines, inadequate operation and maintenance services, poor condition of fleet and equipment, a dearth of trained technical and managerial staff, and absent monitoring and evaluation. GTZ has been providing technical assistance to the GOY and capacity building to selected Governorates and Sana'a Municipality since 1995 through the SWM Decentralization Project, anchored at the Ministry of Local Administration (MOLA).   In Taiz city, the situation is particularly alarming as the existing landfill capacity has long been exceeded, and the waste collection system barely covers 60% of the population. The SWM system was set up in the 1970?s including a landfill located in Hidran, 8 km west of the city. In operation since 1984, the existing site covers an area of 3.2 ha and receives 250-300 tons per day. The current disposal practices are very poor with major negative impacts on the environment on site and surrounding area.   In Sana'a city, the service is somewhat better, but is still in need of much improvement. 15 cleaning departments work under the auspices of Sana'a Municipality and employ about 3,600 laborers. Sana'a is divided into 10 separate waste collection districts, some of which have more than one department because of their high population. All 15 cleaning departments are public, non-profit organizations. The Sana'a landfill is the largest in Yemen. The site has an area of about 7 ha and is 20m deep. It is partially fenced and situated 15 km from the centre of Sana'a. The existing site receives around 1,250 tons of municipal solid waste per day. Waste transportation vehicles are usually randomly inspected at the entrance to the site. Trenches are opened through the rocky ground (to various depths depending on the area) and waste is dumped without compaction and is covered daily by a 15-20 cm of soil layer. The cells are not lined, and neither gas and nor leachate collection and proper disposal are provided.   Investments under Component 2 would encompass works, goods and services/technical assistance to improve SWM in both Sana'a and Taiz. Financing will include the development of a new sanitary landfill in Taiz, measures for the closure and environmental remediation of the existing site, needs assessment and feasibility study of a new landfill site for Sana'a, upgrading of the existing transfer stations and equipment, reinforcement of the existing collection fleet and improved overall operation and maintenance practices. The project will also support, as may be needed, Sana'a Municipality to install a landfill gas (LFG) collection and flaring system in the existing landfill in the aim of generating revenues through Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) financing. The combination of upgrading of informal settlements and improvement to the SWM system within the scope of the project is of critical importance to the improvement of living conditions for poor people. In effect, environmental degradation and lack of solid waste collection (due to the difficulty of access) were systematically identified as one of the top three problems facing residents of informal/squatter areas in Taiz and Sana'a cities. This Component will be closely coordinated with GTZ. MOLA requested the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs to continue funding GTZ's SWMDP beyond the current closing date of end of 2008 to align with IUDP, but funding is still to be confirmed.Component 3: Flood Protection ($1.00 million, in addition to $25.00 million from AFSED, and $3.00 million financing gap)Sana'a city suffers from severe flash floods and faces significant storm water drainage problems due to its geographic location at the heart of the Yemeni highlands at an altitude of 2,200 meters. The city sits on a plateau in an inter-mountainous plain that contains many wadis (natural storm water channels) originating from surrounding mountains and draining towards 'Al-Saylah,' the main north-south wadi running through the city. Due to rapid urban expansion in the last two decades, natural wadi courses have been built-up and populated. Close intervals of heavy rainfall in late summer causes substantial storm water flows from the mountains, subjecting the city to flash floods and causing significant damage to public and private property, endangering human lives and creating major traffic problems in the city. The flooding also endangers the historical patrimony of Old Sana'a, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1984.   A joint USAID and GOY water drainage and flood control project, consisting of converting the length of wadi Al-Saylah into an open paved channel, was initiated in 1996 and is estimated to be finished in 2009. The project built a 5-kilometer long open channel flood structure in Al-Saylah wadi running through the city, including the western portion of the historic center. One of the main problems, however, is that all city storm water drainage systems have been developed to drain into the main wadi Al-Saylah causing it to overflow and damage property (including in Old Sana'a) and representing a threat to lives when flash floods hit busy traffic in Al-Saylah (it has long become a major arterial road). The rapid city expansion and expectations of continuous population growth of 5-7% a year over then next 15 years is already leading to encroachments on surrounding mountains bringing about increased vulnerability to landslides.   The Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development (AFSED) pledged US$25.00 million for priority flood protection works in Sana'a city. The problem, however, is that existing pre-feasibility and design studies commissioned by the Municipality, were prepared without consideration of an overall storm water management plan for the city that would examine storm water drainage, hydraulic and hydrologic issues and propose comprehensive structural and non-structural recommendations for flood risk mitigation and water drainage, including issues of aquifer recharge and land use planning and development regulations. As things stand, the new proposed structures would result in channeling more water into wadi Al-Saylah, which already reaches capacity and overflows at times. At the request of the Ministry of Planning and Sana'a Municipality, a grant application was submitted to the Global Facility for Disaster Risk Reduction (GFDRR) to prepare an overall Integrated Storm Water Drainage Management (ISWDM) plan for Sana'a and identify priority interventions for implementation with AFSED funding and under IUDP.   Investments under Component 3 would complement the flood protection structures to be financed by AFSED. Investments would include the installation of an early flood warning system, implementation of structural and institutional interventions to facilitate the sealing of Al-Saylah and evacuation of people and vehicles in the event of a flood, testing of pilot interventions in selected at-risk areas to reduce water runoff (e.g. porous surfaces), and/or construction of reservoir(s) for storm water reclamation or aquifer recharge. This component will also develop priority instruments for flood damage mitigation (e.g. land development and building regulations for at-risk areas), mainstream risk management responsibilities in the municipal structure and build capacity in flood risk mitigation and preparedness. Complementary AFSED and IDA investments would, therefore, have the benefit of protecting residents from flood risk, increasing the source of water supply, and strengthening municipal capacity.Component 4: Local Government Institutional Development, Capacity Building and Implementation Support ($6.00 million)The Local Authorities Law of 2000 devolved greater authorities to local administrations; it provided local councils with direct responsibility for planning, development, finance, service delivery and social affairs. Local councils are by law assigned responsibilities for budget preparation and accounting, preparation of their own physical and economic plans, raising local revenues, and executing local public works. Yet, implementation of the Law has been slow. Some of the challenges faced by local authorities include:   ·Fragmented structure of local administration. Even though the deconcentrated branches of line ministries were by Law transformed into organs of local governments, in reality this shift has not taken place and local administrations remain fragmented. The local offices of line ministries and national agencies remain de facto affiliated to central government and carry out centrally planned initiatives. This has resulted in splintered budgetary processes and conflicts in infrastructure service delivery arrangements. ·Weak institutional capacity at the local level.The capacity of central government deconcentrated staff is overall weak and inadequate for a significant role expansion at the local level, at least in the short term. It will take some time before local administrations are able to carry out all of their mandated municipal functions. ·Inadequate contribution of local revenues. Public finance in Yemen has historically been within the purview of the central government. Prior to 2000, Governorates and Districts were simply administrative units without an own revenue base. While the Law provides for retaining some local revenues, many aspects of revenue generation remain undeveloped including a fragmented structure of local tax administration, a limited tax base, and inefficient collection. Putting in place a sustainable and adequate revenue base to support needed improvements in local government service delivery will be a major challenge in the years to come.Poor levels of infrastructure provision and maintenance.Current levels of local infrastructure provision and maintenance reflect a persistent state of low revenues and low expenditures. The provision of urban services in cities cannot keep pace with population and spatial growth. Budget allocations to Governorates are inadequate and confined to covering local recurrent expenditures, meaning that execution of programs and investments required are substantially behind the needs. New investments are rarely accompanied by an increase in maintenance budgets.   Against a background of reinvigorated push for decentralization (including the revision of the Law to further empower local councils and the resources at their disposal, and the election of Governors), the cities identified for investment under Component 4 are Sana'a and Taiz. By Law, Sana'a Municipality has a unique legal status that differentiates it from other urban areas in Yemen. Yet, it lacks the implementing law and organizational structure necessary for it to function as the consolidated municipal government. The strengthening of Taiz local government was initiated under TMDFPP, along with construction of local council buildings in several districts to bring under one roof service departments that were previously fragmented. Building on the achievements of TMDFFP, the successful consolidation of administration under the Taiz Governorate capital will serve as a model for other Yemeni Governorates.   Investments under Component 4 would focus on enabling the Government of Yemen to develop its national integrated urban development program, including identification of future investments to alleviate urban poverty. It would also support the development of a viable institutional model for municipal consolidation and service delivery in Sana'a and Taiz. Finally, this Component will support the Ministry of Local Administration's work on strategy development and building the capacity of local government as well as Project Management costs."
2430656,"Higher Education Project II Education (Tertiary education): 100 **Component 1: Develop Quality Programs in Priority Areas**The objective of this component would be to raise the quality of selected higher education programs in Yemen's universities in fields that are particularly critical to the country's national development and employment needs. The component, which would account for some 75 percent of project funds, would finance capacity building in the universities and provide grants for new or upgraded programs, based on international standards, to prepare graduates in identified priority fields contributing to national or regional economic priorities and the needs of private and public sector employers. Grants would cover the costs of developing and introducing the new programs, including TA and training for program renewal and faculty upgrading, visiting professorships, equipment and learning resources, and refurbishment of existing buildings where necessary. New construction would not be included. The objectives of this component would be:(a) to maintain momentum on longer term institutional reform; and(b) to strengthen capacity for project management and for coordination of donor assistance to meet priority needs. (a) *Maintain momentum on longer term institutional reform.* Based on work carried out under the first project, activities have been initiated for reform of university governance and finance, development of a quality assurance mechanism, individual university development plans, and centrally-driven restructuring plans for the university sector as a whole. The need at this stage is to fully define the piloting, capacity building, legal/regulatory and policy actions and time needed to implement these challenging reforms effectively. This subcomponent would finance TA, training and workshops at central and university levels to help implement priority elements of the National Strategy in the areas of governance, finance and quality assurance and to help integrate structure and policy for the tertiary level. *(b) Strengthen capacity for project management and coordination of development assistance.*Learning from the experience of the first project, more attention and resources would be given to ensuring the necessary capacity in the Ministry of Higher Education and universities for all aspects of project management, and for coordination of development assistance. This subcomponent would finance local and international TA to strengthen this capacity as well as funding essential equipment and operating costs for the unit."
2430701,"MA-OUM ER RBIA IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE MODERNIZATION PROJECT Agriculture, fishing, and forestry (Irrigation and drainage): 80,  Water, sanitation and flood protection (General water, sanitation and flood protection sector): 20 The project will have three components: modernization of the irrigation network, support to farmers and support to institutions. Component 1: Modernization of the irrigation network (US$165 million)   The project will provide integrated modernization of specific sectors within irrigation schemes. This involves replacing open canals with pressurized systems, or improving existing pressurized systems to ensure that service is more reliable, demand based, individual farmers can be served separately (rather than as a block as in the current rotation based system). It will also involve rehabilitating and improving regulation of canals with a view to improving service and reducing losses from those canals. This will allow the irrigation agencies (ORMVAs) to determine a safe quantity of water which they can guarantee to participating farmers, and enter into a contract with farmers for that amount. Component 2: Support to farmers (US$5 million)   This component will help participating farmers make best use of their guaranteed quantity of surface water. It will enhance their knowledge, access to technology, their access to financing and markets by promoting partnerships with agro-industries, supermarkets, banks and providers, and forming water user associations. It will involve studies, research and development, technology transfer, training and advisory services, and help improving farmers access to market.Component 3: Support to the irrigation agencies (ORMVAs) (US$5 million)   This component will support: (i) developing and applying systems to monitor water losses in the canals and water consumption in each scheme; (ii) support and information to farmers about weather conditions and recommended irrigation quantities and timing, mobile laboratories and capacity enhancement; (iii) public awareness campaigns; and (iv) support to ORMVAs to increase financial viability (tariff studies, preparation for possible pilot PPP, etc)."

Included under the non-structural measures would be activities aimed at the top-down institutional strengthening needs of the Huai River Basin Commission (HRBC) and provincial and local government institutions, to ensure financial and physical sustainability of the facilities improved under the Project. Bottom-up measures would aim to ensure the active participation of beneficiaries as an integral part of the institutional strengthening component.   3.2 Options. The traditional approach, which focuses on infrastructure construction only and involves only a top-down approach using government institution for management of operations and maintenance (O&M), has been rejected and replaced with a proposed new approach for integrated flood management and drainage improvement. The new approach would focus on integration of structural and non-structural measures at both river-basin level and local level and involve greater community participation in the design, construction and management of lower-level works. The non-structural measures would include use of weather forecasting to have an early flood warning and disaster assessment system for when a flood could be coming. They would also include greater community involvement, which would be developed through the creation of Farmer Drainage Associations (FDAs) that would assume responsibility for all small works (drainage laterals, gates and pumping stations etc.). This would involve the transfer of ownership and O&M of these small works to the FDAs, with Provincial, Municipality and County level Water Resources Bureaus (WRBs) retaining the responsibility for the O&M of larger works on river and water courses and drainage canals, dikes systems and pumping stations.   3.3. Possible Global Environmental Facility (GEF) Component, which would support the areas of pollution control and environmental protection in the Huai River Basin, is being considered. The objectives of such a component would be to adequately address the pollution/water quality/health dimension of Huai River flooding with innovative and cost effective solutions for reducing land-based pollution. In the past environmental disasters have occurred in association with flooding events in the basin. A huge amount of pollution is discharged and stored in countless places in the basin and it is flushed downstream and further to the Yellow Sea during major flooding events. Jiangsu in particular has suffered greatly from these occurrences. The inclusion of this component fits well with the existing water quality functional responsibilities of the HRBC, who will now develop a GEF proposal for about US$5.0 million. ."
2430722,"Cambodia - Higher Education Quality and Capacity Improvement Project Education (Tertiary education): 100 The project consists of four components:  **Component 1**: *Capacity building at both the system and institutional levels.* This component is to strengthen the management capacity of the higher education sub-sector, both at the central Department of Higher Education (DHE) and Accreditation committee of Cambodia (ACC) levels, and of Higher Education Institutions (HEIs). It will include the following two heavily inter-dependent sub-components namely capacity building at the system level and capacity building at the institutional (HEI) level. **Component 2**: *Competitive Research Grants*.The objective of this component is to improve the focus and quality of learning and teaching in public and private HEIs through the strengthening of research capabilities by:  a) Reviewing and renewing curricula of post-graduate research methodology programs, improving the quality of workshops and of graduate seminars presenting research findings, and modernizing science laboratories for locally-based research; b) Developing qualified research staff to increase the relatively low numbers now available, particularly in the key areas of science and math education, industrial technology, health, environment, and agriculture; c) Developing, piloting, and establishing an efficient technically staffed Research Grants Commission for the allocation of public funds for HEI based research activities; and d) Providing consultants to help establish and mount training programs in research methodologies and design in the key areas. **Component 3**: *Scholarships for the disadvantaged*. The objective of this component is to improve access to higher education through scholarships for academically qualified but otherwise disadvantaged students, including females, ethnic minorities, and students from rural areas. The component, as a way to build on and refine the current system of awarding scholarships, and focusing on priority areas in line with the Education Sector Support Project (ESSP), would: a) Improve the management of existing selection and award mechanisms at DHE and both private and public institutional levels; b) Coordinate donor support and increase the overall number of scholarships while rationalizing the proportions to be awarded across disciplines; c) Allocate amounts for the various disciplines, taking board and accommodation, subsistence and learning materials expenses into account; and d) Support the integration of data on scholarships with the overall Higher Education Management Information System (HEMIS) managed by DHE.Component 4: Project Management and Monitoring and Evaluation.

2430858,"Urban Development II Water, sanitation and flood protection (Water supply): 100 3.1 The project is proposed as a specific investment loan with a technical assistance and an investment component, each designed to address the two objectives. However, the team proposes to take a two-track approach in terms of project design at the moment, with a different primary focus under each track. Track One will be focusing more on the municipal reform process with a limited physical component for improving service delivery in northern Thimphu. Track Two will be primarily focusing on improving service delivery in northern Thimphu while incrementally supporting municipal reform/capacity building at TCC. Track One is a more comprehensive fiscal and institutional approach that subsumes service delivery priorities within a vision of strengthening decentralized municipal government. Track Two is a more incremental approach on the institutional agenda with greater emphasis on service delivery outcomes in the short to medium term and as an entry point on the institutional agenda. The team proposes to hold a dialogue with RGOB and TCC on these approaches as soon as the new government is formed and a new Thimphu mayor is elected. The final project design will be decided, based on the dialogue and a better assessment of the political economy factors that will guide the overall urban municipal reform.. In any case, the project will likely include the following two components. The extent and depth of each component and their linkages will depend on which of the two tracks are acceptable to Government.  3.2 Municipal Reform/Institutional Development:The project proposes to help RGOB and TCC to implement the municipal reform program and also improve their urban management and finance systems. This would include a focus on the intergovernmental fiscal system, the regulatory framework that would guide this system, and urban local government system of financing, budgeting and planning. The project would also facilitate the modification of the framework of development control (and permit) system to better calibrate infrastructure development and land pooling to the growth of population and land demand, to facilitate private initiatives and investments, and to increase the fiscal revenues. To this end, the project will provide technical assistance to improve the municipal finance systems and inter-governmental relations, including infrastructure service charges and the reclassification of land for tax purposes. The project will also improve the planning and urban designs, conservation, regulation, and land pooling frameworks. In addition, the project will finance the establishment of a land registry office for Thimphu, in accordance with the recently adopted land and municipal legislation, which will underpin development activities in the LAP areas included under the project, as well as provide services for remaining portions of the city. The project will also provide TA for project implementation, monitoring and evaluation at the central and local government levels.   3.3 Northern Area Development:The project will finance infrastructure improvement and development in the northern LAP areas. The options are: (i) developing full basic infrastructure (roads, water supply and sewerage) in all five areas, which would cost over $25 million; (ii) developing full basic infrastructure in two areas where land pooling arrangements have been progressing, which would cost $10-12 million; (iii) developing infrastructure to varying levels in all five areas depending upon the existing developments and imminent prospects, at a cost of about $15-20 million. RGOB favors option (i) or (ii) for various reasons, including the parity with the planned development of the southern LAP areas financed by ADB and the equity among the landowners within the same LAP areas."

40217647,"Gujarat Solid Waste and Composting  The project objective is to manage and mitigate the uncontrolled dumping of solid waste throughout the municipalities and cities in Gujarat through the construction and operation of composting facilities. Various strategies and technologies (vermi composting and microbial composting) will be supported to ensure that the functions of collecting, treating and processing waste are carried out in an environmentally sound manner. Alternative institutional mechanisms, i.e., different forms of public-private partnerships, are also envisaged in the project to enhance sustainability. This carbon finance operation supports the intent of Government of Gujarat (GoG) to access carbon finance to enhance operational viability of the project, given the inherent difficulties of developing a compost market and challenges in viable Operation & Maintenance (O&M) of composting operations across the Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) in the state.  The project will be implemented in 161 Municipalities in the state of Gujarat. The environmental, social and economic characteristics of these towns are highly variable.They range from large, dense urban settlements with sizeable poor/slum populations to smaller centers which include some rural and forested areas. Several coastal towns are included, and some towns have ecologically fragile zones such as marshes and lakes.The project will be developed in two phases:Phase 1 : This includes composting units for 130 existing Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) for which Gujarat Urban Development Company (GUDC) has been designated as a nodal agency to implement Municipal Solid Waste Management (MSWM). The estimated waste quantity is approximately 1500 tonnes per day (tpd), based on a 2001 Census forecast. The first batch of compost plants in this phase are expected to become operational by early2008.Phase 2 : This will include 31 recently-formed ULBs with smaller populations and possibly the 7 larger municipal corporations. The seven larger municipal corporations generate about 3900 tpd. Total waste generation, including both phases, is about 5500tpd. The compost plants under this phase are expected to commence operation in 2009.The Department of Urban Development has mandated the Gujarat Urban Development Company to prepare and implement a Solid Waste Management program to cater to the161 Municipalities. The State’s Master Plan envisages composting and other alternative energy recovery options for treatment of organics and land-filling the inert as well as residual compost, in conformity with the Municipal Solid Waste Management 2000 Rules.The GUDC is designated to administer and manage the MSWM program which includes waste collection, transport, treatment and disposal on behalf of ULBs.All composting facilities covered by the project are being developed per the current regulatory framework, the 2000 MSW rules, the Gujarat Solid Waste Master Plan, and the revised legislation concerning Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA). Furthermore,site clearances for all composting facilities have been received from the Pollution Control Board. In conformity with GUDC policy, a generic Environmental Management Plan has also been prepared which covers health and safety provisions. A training and sensitization program (with an initial budget of Rs. 5 crores) has been initiated through the Institute of Solid Waste Management, including consultations for communities in the area through IEC activities.Each ULB will have its own composting unit. The waste will be segregated into a wet fraction and a dry fraction with the wet biodegradable wastes being composted in vermiormicrobial composting. In accordance with the MSW Rules, the compost will be recoveredf or reuse and inert wastes from the compost process as well as segregated inert waste will be disposed of in a sanitary/engineered landfill. In order to reduce costs and impact on the environment, GUDC intends to eventually cluster the 130 ULBs into (approximately) clusters for the purpose of land-filling MSW in engineered/sanitary landfills according to the environmental and social selection criteria specified in the MSW 2000 Rules."

The project aims to achieve this by ensuring the aforestation and sustainable management of 3063 ha of planted forests to sequester greenhouse gases, control erosion, enhance biodiversity values, as well as provide additional means of livelihood for local small producers and landholders.Description :The project has two essential components(i) aforestation and sustainable management and(ii) biodiversity values.Component 1: Aforestation and sustainable managementUnder the first objective, the project uses land-use contracts with small and medium landowners to plant 3063 ha of degraded land for a defined period of time. The plantations will be managed by two private companies, Masisa and Mininco, and subject to sustainable forest management criteria and certified by CERTFOR. They will remain certified throughout project tenure to ensure their conformity to high levels of social and environmental criteria. Private land owners will receive compensation for the rent of their lands at US $40/ha and 10% of the revenue at harvest. The BioCarbon fund intends to purchase up to the first 400,000 tons of carbon prior to 2013 and an additional 200,000 tons of carbon from 2013 to 2017.Component 2: Biodiversity valuesThe project aims to carryout activities to promote biodiversity values through the recuperation of degraded areas with native trees species and to promote environmental restoration. The final size, species composition, and location of biodiversity actions will be determined during the preparation phase according to the baseline studies which are underway now."
40222587,"Himachal Pradesh Watershed Management Project  The proposed project will mobilize resource poor farmer (especially women and the objective of the Project is to restore degraded land and make them functioning ecosystems while enhancing the sustainability of the watershed interventions and peoples’ livelihoods options and maximizing carbon sequestration. The project will conduct reforestation and afforestation activities with two primary objectives: i) degraded natural forest corridors that fall within the catchment treated by the Mid-Himalaya Watershed Development Project – that will establish viable biological connectivity among several currently isolated forests and protected areas; ii) this will be undertaken in coordination with the efforts of the MHWDP on sustainable cultivation systems in order to increase soil fertility, protect watersheds and stabilize land-use. These activities will significantly increase tree cover and turning a source of CO2 emissions into a carbon sink in 12,000 Hectares of land (8,000 Ha degraded forest and common land + 4,000 Ha of non arable agriculture waste land).Activities generating Certified Emissions Reductions include the following components:A. Reforestation is the principal carbon sequestration activity, integrating rehabilitation of degraded village common land, revenue waste land and non-arable agricultural land (mostly denuded prior to 1990) into permanently protected natural forest buffer zone for the 600 GPs involved in the MHWDP (12,000 hectares).B. Sustainable Eco-system will provide a potential alternative use of degraded lands – especially upper catchments and the Inter-GP areas (common land) that are degraded to a maximum extent and that are no longer useful to the local population, and it risks further degradation through soil erosion and land slides. Both, biotic and a-biotic pressure on the natural forest will significantly reduce with the bio-carbon project interventions. Such plantation will create self-supporting ecosystems that provide a significant percentage of critical ecosystem services including hydrological stabilization, nutrient recycling and soil generation. Apart from the cash incentive to the local people, these plantation pockets would simultaneously provide products of value to people (NTFPs), especially food and income, to support local livelihoods and significantly reduce the fuelwood and fodder dependency on the forest in 600 GPs (in 12,000Ha)."
40224222,"EarthCare Solid Waste Composting Project  Proposed objective(s)The project objective is to divert part of the waste (equal to the processing capacity of thecompost plant) and reduce the amount of waste disposed in the landfills in Lagos by 10 to 20 percent.This composting project, to be implemented by EarthCare Nigeria Limited (ENL), combines one main objective with other benefits in 2 different sectors. As a response to the pressure on the waste management system, the facility proposes to turn generated (biodegradable) domestic waste and waste from saw mills abattoirs and fruit and vegetable markets into useful compost. Moreover, since the composting operation will be carried out in an aerobic environment, the project will limit the methane emissions to the atmosphere and result in enhancement of the local air quality.While the main issue is about reduction of waste disposal in the landfills, the project will also have benefits in the agricultural sector. Indeed the compost produced by the project will replace inorganic fertilizers that are imported and thus reduce agricultural production costs. In addition, compost is a cleaner product than inorganic fertilizer; hence the project would also, at a larger scale, contribute to the reduction of Green House Gas emissions associated with the production of fertilizers in the exporting countries.Preliminary DescriptionThe project will implement, in a pilot facility, a proprietary bioremediation system developed by EarthCare Technologies, Inc to process mixed solid waste generated in Lagos State into 'grade A' organic frrtilizer which will be marketed to the agricultural community in Lagos State and surrounding areas. Bioremediation is a method for treating solid waste in which organic material is broken down by microorganisms in the presence of oxygen to a point where it can be safely stored, handled and applied to the environment. The fmished product is a competitive fertilizer, all natural and safe for the environment. It also offers the two advantages of repairing damaged soil from chemical fertilizer residues and mining activities and to increasing crop yields significantly.The facility will be installed on a 35-hectare plot of agricultural land in the Farm settlement at Odogunyan in Ikorodu in Lagos State. The project site will consist of a large industrial style steel frame building unit, which will accommodate the processing units plus compost pads and a pond. The raw material, which will comprise saw dust, animal waste, fruits and vegetables anddomestic waste, will be picked up at some srrrn:JUnding facilities and landfills and will be delivered by trucks. It will then be shredded and processed before being spread out in rows.Finally, it is projected that the facility will process in excess of 1,200 metric tones of waste per day from Lagos city enabling to reach a compost production of 500 metric tons per day."
40224237,"Carbon Finance Project 1: Danilovsk Gas Flaring  Proposed objectivesThe objectives of the project are to: i) generate and sell greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions (ERs) and transfer ERs as Emission Reduction Units (ERUs) to buyers under Joint Implementation (JI) mechanism by using flare gas from oil companies that would have been otherwise flared, ii) develop the carbon asset under Joint Implementation.Preliminary DescriptionThe Project includes the utilization of associated petroleum gas (APG) that otherwise would be flared, at a new 36 MW gas power plant (GPP) installed at the North-Danilovsk oil field, Khanty-Mansiysk Okrug, Tumen oblast, Western Siberia, Russia. Twelve GE Jenbacher generating units of 3.0 MW of nominal electrical capacity each are installed in the plant. The generated electricity is being purchased by local users at the North-Danilovsk oil field and neighbouring oil fields and replaces the electricity that wasformerly supplied from the regional electric grid.The electricity users are mainly group pumping stations, which are maintaining oil reservoir pressure by pumping water into the reservoirs 24 hours a day. This requires the GPP generating units to operate 24 hours per day at or near full load to meet demand. The GPP is operating in a concurrent regime with the regional Tumen grid which supplies residual electric demands for the purchasers of Project output. TheTumen grid currently has 11,389 MW of installed generation all of which is fired with natural gas or APG from other oil fields. The GPP is connected to a local 110/35/6 kV substation and to other substations located at the neighbouring oil fields, which are also linked to the North-Danilovsk substation.Currently, the GPP operates at 28 MW average load using ten units under 24 hour operation. The remaining two units stay in reserve to cover forced or maintenance outages. The GPP's own use is 5 GWh with the remaining 240 GWh delivered to local users at sale points located at the GPP switch gears of 6 kV and 35 kV. In this operating mode, 131 GWh per year is delivered to North-Danilovsk oil field consumers via 6 kV switch gear and 109 GWh per year flows to consumers at neighbouring fields via the35 kV switch gear. Annual gross generation is 245 GWh with 5 GWh consumed by the GPP."

The total installed capacity of the Project is 120 MW equipped with 6 sets of bulb tubular turbines with a unit capacity of 20 MW. The estimated electricity delivered to Central China Grid by the Project is 489,220 MWh per year with the average annual operating hours of 4,160 h. Electricity generated by the Project will be delivered to Central China Grid via the 220 kV Taihe Transformer Substation. Central China Grid is dominated by thermal power plants.In the absence of the Project, equivalent amount of annual power output to the Project will be generated and supplied by Central China Grid which the Project is connected to. This is the same with the baseline scenario of the Project. It is expected that the Project as a hydropower source will generate emission reductions by avoiding CO2 emissions from the same amount of electricity generation from Central China Grid, which is mainly composed of traditional thermal power plants. It is expected that the Project will generate emission reductions of 2,273,414 tCO2e over the first 7-year crediting period from October 1, 2011 to September 30, 2018 in total. The Project will not only supply renewable electricity to the grid, but also contribute to sustainable development of the local community, the host country and the world by means of:reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to a business-as-usual scenario;diversifying power sources and mitigating the demand and supply contradiction;promoting the economic development of the underdeveloped area and improving the livelihood of the local poor people; reducing the emission of other pollutants resulting from the power generation industry in China, compared to a business-as-usual scenario; creating 178 long-term employment opportunities for local community during the operation period of the Project and creating several employment opportunities for local community during the construction period of the Project."

Preliminary DescriptionThe project consists of the sale of the first 600,000 emission reductions (ERs) resulting from the use of a new centralized heating system that will replace use of small, inefficient and polluting hot water boilers in existing and new heating areas. This project will be implemented by the Yingkou EDZ Huayuan Heating Company, a municipal SOE. The project will produce greenhouse gas reductions through the increased efficiency of coal use for district heating. Efficiency will be increased by, inter alia, replacing use of an estimated 79 boiler plants that operate with 132 boiler units throughout the Yingkou Economic Development Zone with a more efficient central heating system.The central heating system will be partially inanced by a World Bank loan under the Liaoning Third Medium Cities Infrastructure Project (P099224), comprising:(a) about 85 km primary and about 70 km secondary network;(b) about 66 group substations and 11 pilot building level substations;(c) a booster pump station;(d) heat meters; and(e) ancillary and control systems.The underlying investment is partly financed by a World Bank loan under the Liaoning Third Medium Cities Infrastructure Project (LMC3). The heating supply will be purchased from the existing Huanen Yingkou power plant. Therefore, the efficiency of heat generation is substantially higher compared to heat generated from small and inefficient heat only boilers that are presently operating in the project area. This carbon offset project falls under the large-scale clean development mechanism (CDM) project activity category and applies the newly approved methodology AM0058."

40235608,"TN-CBF Sidi Daoud Wind Farm Project  2. ObjectivesThe development objective of this project (PDO) is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by replacing electricity generated from fossil fuel-fired power plants by electricity from a newly built wind farm with an installed capacity of 34.32 MW. The Sidi Daoud wind farm is expected to generate about 50,000 tCO2eq emission reductions (ERs) annually. 55% of the emission reduction potential in the energy and the industrial sector, excluding gas flaring projects.Source : National Agency for Energy Conservation (ANME), ' Portefeuille de projets MDP dans les secteurs de l'Energie et de l'Industrie -Task force MDP -Minist're de l'Industrie, de l'Energie et des petites et moyennes entreprises'.4. DescriptionThe Sidi Daoud Wind Farm project is the first of this size in Tunisia and the first to beconnected to the national grid, thus paving the way to the scaling-up of wind power in thecountry.  The wind farm is located in Sidi Daoud approximately 100 km North-East of Tunis. STEG chose this location based on a feasibility study by US Power (1991) of the national wind power potential. The Sidi Daoud wind farm comprises 26 wind turbines of 1.32 MW each and a transformation substation. A newly built 22.6 km high voltage transmission line, replacing an old medium voltage line, allows the evacuation of the power generated by the wind farm to the national electricity grid.The project is expected to generate approximately 95,000 MWh per year (load factor:32%), all of which is to be totally fed into the national grid.  As thermal plants dominate STEG's power generation, the implementation of the project will lead to greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions that would have otherwise been emitted by fossil fuel-fired power plants. The CDM enables the creation, issuance, and sale of CERs from projects undertaken indeveloping countries that reduce emissions of GHGs. This CFO will facilitate the transaction of the CER's between STEG and the Bank-managed Spanish Carbon Fund, the terms and conditions of which will be agreed in the Emission Reduction Purchase Agreement (ERPA) to be signed by the two parties.The purchase will be a performance-based contract under which payments are triggered by successful verification of the reduction of GHG emissions by an accredited independent auditor, or Designated Operational Entity (DOE), under CDM rules. The quantity of CERs to be contracted, the length of time over which the purchase will be made, and the price to be paid will be agreed between the Bank and STEG before ERPA signature. In addition, the Bank will facilitate registration of the project with the CDM Executive Board."
